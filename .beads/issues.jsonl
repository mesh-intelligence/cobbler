Cobbler is a CLI tool that orchestrates AI coding agents to plan and execute software development work.

Executive Summary: cobbler orchestrates AI agents to do software dev work; it is not a task tracker, IDE plugin, or CI system\n2. Introduction: context (AI agents need coordination), problem (manual agent orchestration is slow and error-prone), what cobbler does (connects to crumbs cupboard, plans work, executes via agents)\n3. Why this project: fills the gap between task storage (crumbs) and agent execution; leverages existing cupboard interfaces\n4. Planning and Implementation: success criteria (agents complete doc and code tasks autonomously), phases table, risks table\n5.

Describe how cobbler is built: components, interfaces, data flow, and design decisions.\n\nSections to write:\n1. System Overview: cobbler connects to crumbs cupboard, coordinates AI agents to plan and execute work. Lifecycle of a work item through cobbler (ready → claimed → prompt built → agent executes → quality gate → closed). Coordination pattern: pull-based (cobbler queries cupboard for ready crumbs).\n2. Main interfaces: Cupboard integration (import crumbs Go module, GetTable, Get/Set pattern), Agent interface (Run method, Tool interface), Executor interface (claim, execute, close loop).\n3. System Components: CLI (cobra), Config (viper), Planner (analyze docs, propose crumbs), Executor (pick up and implement work), Agent (LLM abstraction, Claude impl), Prompt Builder (templates for doc/code tasks), Crumbs Client (thin wrapper around imported crumbs module).\n4. Design Decisions: (a) import crumbs as Go module not CLI wrapper, (b) agent interface for provider abstraction, (c) prompt templates in internal/prompt not embedded, (d) Claude API first with interface for future providers.\n5. Technology Choices: Go, cobra, viper, crumbs module, anthropic-sdk-go.\n6. Project Structure: cmd/cobbler/, pkg/ (agent, planner, executor, crumbs), internal/ (prompt, config, claude).\n7. Implementation Status: phase 1 focus is cobbler stitch --docs.\n\n## Design Decisions\n- Cupboard accessed via imported Go module (github.com/petar-djukic/crumbs)\n- Agent interface allows swapping LLM providers; start with Claude via anthropic-sdk-go\n- Prompt templates stored in internal/prompt/ as Go templates or embedded strings\n- Executor handles both doc and code modes with shared claim/close logic\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All required sections per architecture-format present\n- [ ] Components and interfaces described with enough detail for PRD authors\n- [ ] Design decisions numbered with rationale\n- [ ] Technology choices table present\n- [ ] Project structure directory tree present\n- [ ] Style follows documentation-standards\n- [ ] File saved as docs/ARCHITECTURE.md","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.116325-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.116325-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.117113-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"},{"issue_id":"cobbler-mq5.2","depends_on_id":"cobbler-mq5.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-05T18:46:21.118001-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}
